    <h1>Kerokerokeroppi deserves better.</h1>
    <p>About the Injustices in the World: An Analysis by Maggie Yang</p>
    <h2>In my opinion, Keroppi deserves to be AT LEAST in the Top 10 of the <a href="https://www.sanrio.co.jp/special/characterranking/2023/en/result/">2023 Sanrio Character Ranking</a>.
        .</h2>
    <p>There is not enough Keroppi merch in this world. You would normally think that such a NICE, CUTE FROG would make it into the top 10 of the fan voted popularity polls. But, the monstrosity that is Hangyodon has taken up a precious space in 7th place. I see this as an injustice to say the least. Because of this UNREASONABLE decision by 1.8 million people, I am forced to brand myself as a Pompompurin lover. No hate to Pompompurin, but he's only a placeholder for the one true #1 in my heart...Kerokerokeroppi.</p>
